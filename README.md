# Commandprompt-Lotto
A simple commandline based lotto app that tries to win the game within a human lifetime.
# Motivation
Program was made as a coursework while studying at Tampere university of applied sciences.

The goal was to learn how to use packets in java, how to use github and how to make a complete program from start to finish and release it.

# Language
The program was written in java

# Settings
There are a few variables at the start of the main.java file that act as settings for the program
```java
class main {
    //Settings
    static int howManyNumbers = 7; #how many numbers there are in total
    static int minNumber = 1; #what's the smallest number in the game
    static int maxNumber = 40; #whats the largest number in the game
    static int averageHumanLifetime = 85; #what is the length of time you need to win the jackpot in, for the program to end
```
These can be changed as you see fit.
